I recently developed my own personal branding website, utilizing tools I acquired through both a structured course and self-directed learning. This website showcases information about myself and my experiences within the job market. As you will notice, my resume may not present previous job experiences or a prepared CV in the traditional sense. However, I hope the content I've included sufficiently highlights my proficiency in CSS and HTML, demonstrating the depth of my knowledge despite the absence of formal work history. I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge this project presented. I believe with more time to invest, the outcome would have even more closely aligned with my own expectations. This experience not only allowed me to showcase my skills but also reinforced my ability to learn and apply new technologies effectively
I really enjoyed writing the code and designing. It didn't turn out exactly as I wanted, but what resulted is still beautiful. A lot of time and thought need to be invested in the preliminary planning, which takes up most of the time. In my opinion, with a longer timeframe, it's possible to achieve better results
