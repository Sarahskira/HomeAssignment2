I really enjoyed writing the code and designing. It didn't turn out exactly as I wanted, but what resulted is still beautiful.
A lot of time and thought need to be invested in the preliminary planning,
which takes up most of the time. In my opinion, with a longer timeframe, it's possible to achieve better results.
